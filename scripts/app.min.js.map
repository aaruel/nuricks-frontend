Like in the former example, you have the\n     * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n     *\n     * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n     *\n     * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n     * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n     * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n     * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n     *\n     * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n     *\n     * \\@stable\n     */\n    var SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} _renderer\n         * @param {?} _elementRef\n         */\n        function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n            this._renderer = _renderer;\n            this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n            /** @internal */\n            this._optionMap = new Map();\n            /** @internal */\n            this._idCounter = 0;\n            this.onChange = function (_) { };\n            this.onTouched = function () { };\n        }\n        /**\n         * @param {?} value\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n            this.value = value;\n            var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n            if (id == null) {\n                this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n            }\n            var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n            var _this = this;\n            this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n                _this.value = valueString;\n                fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n            };\n        };\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn;

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

To mask `cvv` input, for instance, `type: \"password\"` can be used.\n * @property {boolean} [formatInput=true] Enable or disable automatic formatting on this field.\n * @property {object|boolean} [select] If truthy, this field becomes a `<select>` dropdown list. This can only be used for `expirationMonth` and `expirationYear` fields. If you do not use a `placeholder` property for the field, the current month/year will be the default selected value.\n * @property {string[]} [select.options] An array of 12 strings, one per month. This can only be used for the `expirationMonth` field. For example, the array can look like `['01 - January', '02 - February', ...]`.\n * @property {number} [maxlength] This option applies only to the CVV and postal code fields. Will be used as the `maxlength` attribute of the input if it is less than the default. The primary use cases for the `maxlength` option are: limiting the length of the CVV input for CVV-only verifications when the card type is known and limiting the length of the postal code input when cards are coming from a known region.\n * @property {number} [minlength=3] This option applies only to the postal code field. Will be used as the `minlength` attribute of the input. The default value is 3, representing the Icelandic postal code length. This option's primary use case is to increase the `minlength`, e.g. for US customers, the postal code `minlength` can be set to 5.\n */\n\n/**\n * An object that has {@link module:braintree-web/hosted-fields~field field objects} for each field.
